# End Session

Run this procedure exactly. Do NOT write any project code during this procedure. The session is NOT done until the final `git push` and `bd dolt push` succeed.

## Step 1: Close completed tasks

For each task completed this session:

- Verify the work is actually done (tests pass, acceptance criteria met).
- Close: `bd close <task-id> --reason="<brief summary>" --json`

For tasks started but not finished:

- Update with progress notes: `bd update <task-id> --description="<updated with what's done, what's next>" --json`
- Either leave status as `in_progress` (resume next session) or change back to `open` (let someone else take it).

Never leave a task `in_progress` just because the session ended without deciding.

## Step 2: Check for orphans

`bd doctor` only works in server mode. Skip it in embedded mode (the default):

```bash
if [ -d ".beads/embeddeddolt" ]; then
  echo "Embedded mode — skipping bd doctor."
else
  bd doctor
fi
```

For any orphans found in server mode:

- If actually done, close it.
- If work is incomplete, file a follow-up task with `bd create`.

## Step 3: Commit session work

- Stage and commit uncommitted work. Include issue IDs: `"<message> (<task-id>)"`.
- If `scratch.md` exists (any casing), ensure it's in `.gitignore`. Do NOT read it.
- Don't push yet — we'll do one push at the end.

## Step 4: Update CLAUDE.md (if needed)

Only update if this session changed project-level rules, conventions, tooling, or dependencies. Read CLAUDE.md only if you need to update it. If nothing changed, skip entirely.

Justifies an edit: new build/test command, new hard rule, new gotcha, removed/renamed something it references. Does NOT belong: progress tracking, session history, architecture decisions (→ ADR), code style (→ linter).

Keep under 80 lines. "Don't X, do Y" — never prohibit without an alternative.

## Step 5: Update plan.MD

Read plan.MD. Update these sections:

**Overall Plan** — Only if the plan itself changed (epic completed, new phase started).

**Current Status** — Replace the existing entry with ONE entry dated today. Be specific: features shipped, tasks closed (with IDs), decisions made. End with a **Next session:** line naming 1-2 recommended tasks by ID. Only one entry ever exists — each session overwrites the last.

**Known Issues / Blockers** — Add or remove as needed.

plan.MD should NOT contain a "What Remains" section — that's tracked as tasks.

## Step 6: Check for ADR-worthy decisions

Review what happened this session. Did any decisions meet the ADR criteria?

- A choice between multiple viable options where alternatives were considered.
- Affects how future code will be structured.
- Non-trivial to reverse.
- The "why" isn't obvious from the code.

If yes, invoke `/adr` for each one — propose the title and summary, write on approval. If nothing qualifies, move on.

## Step 7: Commit docs

Commit: `docs: end-of-session update — <brief summary>`. Include any task IDs closed this session.

## Step 8: Land the plane

**This step is non-negotiable. The session is not complete until both pushes succeed.**

1. `git pull --rebase` — pull any remote changes first.
2. `git push` — push everything.
3. `git status` — must show "up to date with origin/<branch>".
4. `bd dolt push` — push task data to remote.
5. If any step fails, resolve the issue and retry. Do not give up.

Do NOT end the session with unpushed work. Do NOT tell the user "ready to push when you are." Push it yourself.

## Step 9: Session summary

First, check how many tasks are currently ready:

```bash
bd ready --json
```

Print for the user:

- What was accomplished (2-3 sentences).
- Tasks closed this session (with IDs).
- **Next session focus:** If 5 or fewer tasks are ready, recommend the top 1-2 by ID and title. If more than 5 are ready, flag it: "X tasks are currently ready — this may mean dependencies aren't fully set up. Consider whether some of these should be sequenced before the next session." Then recommend the top 2-3 to focus on based on priority and logical order.
- Any items needing user attention (manual testing, decisions, external dependencies).
- Confirmation that everything is pushed and the working tree is clean.

Then prompt: **"Session complete. Run `/clear` to reset the context window before your next session."**
