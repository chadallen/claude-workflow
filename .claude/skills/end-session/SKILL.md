# End Session

Run this procedure exactly. Do NOT write any project code during this procedure. The session is NOT done until the final `git push` and `bd dolt push` succeed.

## Step 1: Close completed tasks

For each task completed this session:

- Verify the work is actually done (tests pass, acceptance criteria met).
- Close: `bd close <task-id> --reason="<brief summary>" --json`

For tasks started but not finished:

- Update with progress notes: `bd update <task-id> --description="<updated with what's done, what's next>" --json`
- Either leave status as `in_progress` (resume next session) or change back to `open` (let someone else take it).

Never leave a task `in_progress` just because the session ended without deciding.

## Step 2: Check for orphans

`bd doctor` only works in server mode. Skip it in embedded mode (the default):

```bash
if [ -d ".beads/embeddeddolt" ]; then
  echo "Embedded mode — skipping bd doctor."
else
  bd doctor
fi
```

For any orphans found in server mode:

- If actually done, close it.
- If work is incomplete, file a follow-up task with `bd create`.

## Step 3: Commit session work

- Stage and commit uncommitted work. Include issue IDs: `"<message> (<task-id>)"`.
- If `scratch.md` exists (any casing), ensure it's in `.gitignore`. Do NOT read it.
- Don't push yet — we'll do one push at the end.

## Step 4: Read project docs

Read CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, and plan.MD in full.

## Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md (if needed)

Update only if this session changed project-level rules, conventions, tooling, or dependencies. If nothing changed, leave it alone.

**What justifies a CLAUDE.md edit:**
- New command Claude needs to know (added a lint step, changed the test runner)
- New hard rule discovered (new secret, new data constraint)
- New gotcha that will bite future sessions (add to "Things That Will Bite You" if the section exists; create one if it doesn't)
- Removed or renamed something CLAUDE.md references

**What does NOT go in CLAUDE.md:**
- Progress tracking, session history, task lists → plan.MD
- Accumulated gotchas that are task-adjacent but not universal → plan.MD Build Notes
- Architecture decisions → `docs/adr/`
- Code style rules → linter config

**Before adding anything, apply the cost test:**
- Would removing this cause Claude to make a mistake? If not, don't add it.
- Is this universally applicable to every session? If it's only relevant sometimes, put it in a skill file and reference it with `@path`.
- Is there already a line that says something similar? Consolidate rather than duplicate.

**Style rules:**
- "Don't X, do Y" — never leave a prohibition without a concrete alternative
- Keep the file under 80 lines. If it's creeping up, split content into skills or ADRs.
- Reserve emphasis (IMPORTANT, YOU MUST) for 2-3 rules that truly matter

## Step 6: Update and prune PRD.md (if needed)

Update only if product requirements or acceptance criteria changed.

Prune completed specs — detailed schemas, API contracts, or layout definitions for features that are fully built and tested become dead weight once the code is the source of truth. Replace with one-line pointers to source files.

If nothing changed, leave it alone.

## Step 7: Update plan.MD

plan.MD has three sections in the workflow:

**Overall Plan** — The high-level phase/epic roadmap. Which epic is active. What's next after the current one. Update only if the plan itself changed.

**Current Status** — What was accomplished this session. Be specific: features shipped, bugs fixed, decisions made, tasks closed (with IDs). Include the date. End the entry with a **Next session:** line naming the 1-2 recommended tasks by ID and title (from Step 12's ready-task check). If there are >5 ready tasks, note that too so the next session knows to address the sequencing before picking up work.

**Known Issues / Blockers** — Anything unresolved that isn't already a task: blocked-on-user decisions, manual testing needed, environment issues, open design questions.

plan.MD should NOT contain a "What Remains" section — that's tracked as tasks.

**Prune session history.** Keep at most 3 recent entries in Current Status. Before removing older entries, check for decisions or rationale not captured elsewhere — migrate anything important to Overall Plan or Known Issues.

## Step 8: Check for ADR-worthy decisions

Review what happened this session. Did any decisions meet the ADR criteria?

- A choice between multiple viable options where alternatives were considered.
- Affects how future code will be structured.
- Non-trivial to reverse.
- The "why" isn't obvious from the code.

If yes, invoke `/adr` for each one — propose the title and summary, write on approval. If nothing qualifies, move on.

## Step 9: Consistency check

Re-read all three files. Verify:

- plan.MD doesn't contradict PRD.md.
- CLAUDE.md has no stale tool/pattern references.
- Task state aligns with plan.MD's claimed progress.
- plan.MD has no "What Remains" list.
- No more than 3 session entries in Current Status.

## Step 10: Commit docs

Commit: `docs: end-of-session update — <brief summary>`. Include any task IDs closed this session.

## Step 11: Land the plane

**This step is non-negotiable. The session is not complete until both pushes succeed.**

1. `git pull --rebase` — pull any remote changes first.
2. `git push` — push everything.
3. `git status` — must show "up to date with origin/<branch>".
4. `bd dolt push` — push task data to remote.
5. If any step fails, resolve the issue and retry. Do not give up.

Do NOT end the session with unpushed work. Do NOT tell the user "ready to push when you are." Push it yourself.

## Step 12: Session summary

First, check how many tasks are currently ready:

```bash
bd ready --json
```

Print for the user:

- What was accomplished (2-3 sentences).
- Tasks closed this session (with IDs).
- **Next session focus:** If 5 or fewer tasks are ready, recommend the top 1-2 by ID and title. If more than 5 are ready, flag it: "X tasks are currently ready — this may mean dependencies aren't fully set up. Consider whether some of these should be sequenced before the next session." Then recommend the top 2-3 to focus on based on priority and logical order.
- Any items needing user attention (manual testing, decisions, external dependencies).
- Confirmation that everything is pushed and the working tree is clean.

Then prompt: **"Session complete. Run `/clear` to reset the context window before your next session."**
